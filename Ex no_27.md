# EX 27 C . C PROGRAM TO DECLARE DATATYPE USING TYPEDEF 
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program to declare datatype using typedef.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Declare a variable value of type char. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Check eligible for marriage. 
6. If age >= 21, print "Eligible". 
7. If false, print " Not Eligible". 
8. End. 

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h> 
typedef int MyInt; 
int main() { 
    MyInt num = 10; 
  printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num); 
  return 0; 
}
```

## Output:
The Value of num is : 10


## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
